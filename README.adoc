[.lead]
Bookshop is a component development workflow for static websites. Bookshop currently supports Jekyll, and will support a wider array of static site generators in the near future.

---

Bookshop is currently in a beta of version 2.0, some small changes to the configuration are possible prior to general release.

The best current example of a Bookshop 2.0 project can be found at https://github.com/bglw/bookshop-example[bglw/bookshop-example], which should provide an in-situ example of the concepts discussed below.
